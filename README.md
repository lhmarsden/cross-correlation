# cross-correlation
In signal processing, cross-correlation can be used to quantify the similarity between 2 series of data, as a function of the lag (often in time) between the two datasets. It can be used to quantify the lag time between two correlating time series of data, for example the time between when most people leave work and the time when the traffic on the road is worst! The correlation coefficient is often normalised to between -1 and 1, where identical series of data have a maximum correlation coefficient of 1 where the lag time is zero, and series that are identical but are opposite in polarity have a maximum correlation coefficient of -1.  In this respository, there are 2 scripts:

xcorr.py: Two synthetic waveforms are created, one with numerical noise and one without. The traces have the same dominant frequency, and are separated in time by a lag. In this script, both waveforms are plotted in one subplot. In a second subplot, the cross-correlation output is plotted as a function of the time lag, and the maximum cross-correlation coefficient is annotated on the plot alongside the lag between the two waveforms.
